## Image manipulation

Image manipulation is supplied by [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) and
[opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), which wraps
[the OpenCV library](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) library.

Visualizations are built using
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).
