The vector database is a self-hosted [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)
instance accessed via
[the Qdrant Python client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client).


Embeddings are computed using
[sentence-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/sentence-transformers).

An alternative embedding source is
[Qdrant's FastEmbed](https://qdrant.tech/articles/fastembed/).
