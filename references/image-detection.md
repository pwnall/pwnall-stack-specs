### Image detection inference stack

The image detection model is powered by the
[cvlib](https://github.com/arunponnusamy/cvlib) Computer Vision
library for Python, which uses
[OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/) and
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf).

`cvlib` is configured to use the `yolov3-tiny` model.
